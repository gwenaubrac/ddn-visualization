Generate Back-end Data for Multi-Database Studies Visualization Tool

Distributed data networks and multi-database studies offer new ways of conducting health research that is rapid, rigorous, and reproducible. However, the study populations contained in each database may be heterogeneous in terms of event rates and confounding structures. This project used CPRD data on different cohorts to generate data describing the rate of events, the prevalence of confounders, and the association between confounders and the event over time. This data will be combined with results from other data sources to test a visualization tool using R Shiny. The interactive tool will display features of the populations in each database to help researchers identify key differences between them at a glance.

Access to CPRD data is supported by ISAC protocol 24_004042. This work is conducted at the Lady Davis Institute of the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.
